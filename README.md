🎬 What is a Movie Recommendation System?
A Movie Recommendation System is a type of information filtering system that predicts and suggests films to users based on their preferences, behavior, or demographic information. It helps users discover movies they are likely to enjoy without searching manually.

🎯 Purpose
To personalize the user experience on streaming platforms like Netflix, Prime Video, or Disney+.

To increase user engagement and content consumption.

To filter through vast libraries and surface relevant content.

🔧 How Does It Work?
Recommendation systems use algorithms and data to predict user preferences. Here are the main types:

🧩 Types of Recommendation Systems
1. Content-Based Filtering
Recommends movies similar to what the user has liked before.

Uses metadata: genres, directors, actors, descriptions, etc.

Example: If you like The Dark Knight, you may also like Inception (same director, genre, tone).

2. Collaborative Filtering
Based on user behavior and ratings.

Finds patterns between users with similar tastes.

Example: “Users who liked Movie A also liked Movie B.”

Two Types:
User-Based Collaborative Filtering

Item-Based Collaborative Filtering

3. Hybrid Approach
Combines both content-based and collaborative filtering.

Used by Netflix and Amazon for more accurate results.

4. Knowledge-Based Filtering
Based on explicit input (e.g., mood, occasion).

Doesn’t rely on past user behavior.

Understand natural language queries:
"Suggest a sci-fi movie with time travel and an emotional story."

Provide contextual and conversational recommendations

Dynamically generate descriptions and reasons for suggestions

Learn and adapt based on continuous interaction
